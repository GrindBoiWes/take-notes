# take-notes
An app for keeping yourself on task

## Description
You may feel like there aren't enough hours in the day to get everything done. Well, you are correct. With this app, it will be easier to keep on top of those pesky tasks that are taking up your time. With Take Notes, simply enter in a title of your task, followed by a brief description and click that save button. Continue to add each task that is on your list of todo's. Once a task has been completed, simply click the trash icon located next to your new note (left hand side of the page), and now you will be ready to move onto your next task. Finish everything, or continuously add tasks as soon as it comes up.

For running this app, you will need to run node server.js in the terminal, then follow the local host link inside to visit the page.
